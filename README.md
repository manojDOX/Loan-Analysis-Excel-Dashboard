# Excel Loan Portfolio Performance Dashboard

## Project Objective

This case study applies advanced data analysis techniques using Excel to deeply understand and effectively manage a consumer loan portfolio. This involves assessing loan risk profiles, evaluating financial performance metrics, gaining insights into borrower behaviors, and ultimately, developing the comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard seen below.

These efforts aim to provide strategic recommendations for optimizing loan portfolio management, mitigating risks, and enhancing decision-making processes for financial institutions.

## Dashboard Features

This fully interactive dashboard provides a 360-degree view of the loan portfolio, allowing for dynamic analysis.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Total Loans:** Overall volume of loans issued.
* **Avg. Loan Amount:** The average value per loan.
* **Avg. Interest Rate:** The weighted average interest rate across the portfolio.
* **Default Rate:** The percentage of loans in default.
* **Total Rec. Principle:** Total principal recovered from loans.
* **Recovery Rate:** The percentage of outstanding principal recovered.

### Interactive Filters (Slicers)

The entire dashboard can be filtered dynamically by:
* Year (2007-2014)
* Loan Grade (A-G)
* Region (e.g., cannught, leinster, munster, etc.)
* Employee Length (in years)
* Income Category (Low, Medium, High)

### Core Visualizations & Analyses

1.  **Loan Distribution by Purpose:** A horizontal bar chart showing the total number of loans for different purposes (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card, home improvement).
2.  **Trend Analysis Over Time:** A line chart tracking the evolution of **Total Loan Amount**, **Average Interest Rate**, and **Default Rate** from 2007 to 2014.
3.  **Risk Profile Analysis Heatmap:** A matrix showing risk concentration (likely default rate or interest rate) by **Loan Grade** and **Purpose**.
4.  **Loan Status Overview:** A pie chart illustrating the breakdown of the portfolio between **Good Loans** and **Critical Loans**.
5.  **Loan Profitability Index (LPI):** A series of bar charts comparing profitability across four key dimensions: **Grade**, **Loan Condition**, **Term (36/60 months)**, and **Income Category**.
6.  **Relationship Between Loan Amount and Annual Income:** A scatter plot to identify correlations and patterns between borrower income and requested loan size.
7.  **Forecast of Average Loan Amount:** A time-series line chart forecasting the potential trend of average loan amounts with upper and lower confidence bounds.
8.  **High Risk and High Interest Analysis:** Summary tables identifying the riskiest segments by **Region** and **Purpose**, and a breakdown of loan counts by purpose and interest rate.

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** Utilizes Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and advanced dashboarding techniques.
